                        the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has
                        been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the
                        1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
                        scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has
                        survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
                        electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
                        It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of
                        Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and
                        more recently with desktop publishing software like
                        Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. Why
                        do we use it? It is a long established fact that a
                        reader will be distracted by the readable content of a
                        page when looking at its layout. The point of using
                        Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal
                        distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content
                        here, content here', making it look like readable
                        English. Many desktop publiearch for 'lorem ipsum' will
                        uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various
                        versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by
                        accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the
